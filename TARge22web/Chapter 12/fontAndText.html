      The
      <a class="breed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>,
      or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder
      and guardian of sheep.
    </p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>
      The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region of
      north-central France, where it was traditionally used both for herding
      sheep and to defend them. The first written mention of the shepherd dogs
      of Brie is thought to be in the Cours complet d'agriculture of
      Jean-Baptiste Fran√ßois Rozier, who in 1783 wrote that the "chien de Brie"
      was long-haired and usually black; that in the open plains there was
      little danger from wolves, and so the dogs were used more for herding than
      for defence.
